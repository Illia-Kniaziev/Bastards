### To-do list before publishing
1) move to backend service different from plain requests to github. Firestore would be doing well.
2) add widgets support to let users see breif daily info on their desktops.
3) work on news tab for the app to monitor latest events on the frontline.
4) integrate push notifications to tell users about the latest updates.
5) consider adding a WatchKit extension to make access to the information even easier.

P.S. I did not have much time to create the app, hope it's OK :)
